These\r\n    functions are mutually exclusive.  Use ajaxSubmit if you want\r\n    to bind your own submit handler to the form.  For example,\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function() {\r\n        $('#myForm').on('submit', function(e) {\r\n            e.preventDefault(); // <-- important\r\n            $(this).ajaxSubmit({\r\n                target: '#output'\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    Use ajaxForm when you want the plugin to manage all the event binding\r\n    for you.  For example,\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function() {\r\n        $('#myForm').ajaxForm({\r\n            target: '#output'\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    You can also use ajaxForm with delegation (requires jQuery v1.7+), so the\r\n    form does not have to exist when you invoke ajaxForm:\r\n\r\n    $('#myForm').ajaxForm({\r\n        delegation: true,\r\n        target: '#output'\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    When using ajaxForm, the ajaxSubmit function will be invoked for you\r\n    at the appropriate time.\r\n*/\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Feature detection\r\n */\r\nvar feature = {};\r\nfeature.fileapi = $(\"<input type='file'/>\").get(0).files !== undefined;\r\nfeature.formdata = window.FormData !== undefined;\r\n\r\nvar hasProp = !!$.fn.prop;\r\n\r\n// attr2 uses prop when it can but checks the return type for\r\n// an expected string.  this accounts for the case where a form \r\n// contains inputs with names like \"action\" or \"method\"; in those\r\n// cases \"prop\" returns the element\r\n$.fn.attr2 = function() {\r\n    if ( ! hasProp ) {\r\n        return this.attr.apply(this, arguments);\r\n    }\r\n    var val = this.prop.apply(this, arguments);\r\n    if ( ( val && val.jquery ) || typeof val === 'string' ) {\r\n        return val;\r\n    }\r\n    return this.attr.apply(this, arguments);\r\n};\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * ajaxSubmit() provides a mechanism for immediately submitting\r\n * an HTML form using AJAX.\r\n */\r\n$.fn.ajaxSubmit = function(options) {\r\n    /*jshint scripturl:true */\r\n\r\n    // fast fail if nothing selected (http://dev.jquery.com/ticket/2752)\r\n    if (!this.length) {\r\n        log('ajaxSubmit: skipping submit process - no element selected');\r\n        return this;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var method, action, url, $form = this;\r\n\r\n    if (typeof options == 'function') {\r\n        options = { success: options };\r\n    }\r\n    else if ( options === undefined ) {\r\n        options = {};\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    method = options.type || this.attr2('method');\r\n    action = options.url  || this.attr2('action');\r\n\r\n    url = (typeof action === 'string') ? $.trim(action) : '';\r\n    url = url || window.location.href || '';\r\n    if (url) {\r\n        // clean url (don't include hash vaue)\r\n        url = (url.match(/^([^#]+)/)||[])[1];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    options = $.extend(true, {\r\n        url:  url,\r\n        success: $.ajaxSettings.success,\r\n        type: method || $.ajaxSettings.type,\r\n        iframeSrc: /^https/i.test(window.location.href || '') ?
